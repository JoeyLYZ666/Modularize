	yeutter sees gatt consensus on farm  reform u s  representative clayton yeutter said  ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural  reform under the latest uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and  gatt yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural  reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture delegates from countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest gatt round was launched in punta del este uruguay last september yeutter said at least people seem to be going down the same road but how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely there seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there yeutter said however the hard work is still to come with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead he said it is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy he said he said the long term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas this would help agriculture because some its inefficient non productive segments would stop operating he said individual segments in many countries may lose in the process but it should result in a more rational system of world wide production within or years he said it is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the u s is spending billion dlrs a year and the european community probably more than that which is an ineffective use of financial resources he said asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations he said one has to be politically realistic if there is any chance of getting it agricultural  reform done in two to three years it s going to have to be as part of a larger package reuter
