	paribas seeking to adjust ecuador oil facility banque paribas which arranged a mln dlr loan for ecuador last year to pre finance oil exports wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake bankers said but the french bank s plan which would effectively postpone repayment of about mln dlrs of the loan for several months is running into stiff resistance from many of the members of the loan syndicate the pipeline that carries all ecuador s oil exports was ruptured in the march tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about mln dlrs to repair president leon febres cordero on friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that ecuador as a result would maintain january s suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt payments were halted in january because of the drop in the price of oil which accounts for nearly two thirds of ecuador s export earnings and pct of government revenue although sympathetic to ecuador s plight many banks in the paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks bankers said the month oil financing facility which was signed last october is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a latin american nation since the region s debt crisis erupted in august because it was a voluntary deal many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to otherwise they fear the gradual re establishment of normal market conditions for latin borrowers will be set back there s a lot of reluctance by the other banks they feel it s a different facility and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad one banker commented reuter
