	yeutter says japanese curb all but certain u s  representative clayton yeutter said it was all but certain president reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on japanese exports as planned asked in a television interview what the chance was for reagan to cancel the scheduled pct tariffs on japanese electronic exports he said slim to none reagan announced on march he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for japan s failure to honor a agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to u s products yeutter on the nbc program today said the united states did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once japan began fulfilling the agreement he said japanese negotiators last week told u s officials they were honoring the pact but yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance asked how long that would take he said we want to see a pattern of compliance so in a minimum i would say that would take a few weeks yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on mln dlrs worth of japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers he said he did not think japan would retaliate it seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict the japanese understand that full well yeutter said he added japan might challenge the tariffs in the general agreement on tariffs and  gatt but that s more of a paper kind of exercise and i don t really expect to see any adverse impact on u s  yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a washington visit later this month by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone he said he hoped the visit which is to have  as a major issue would be productive but i don t see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit reuter
