	u k lenders offer more fixed rate mortgages more u k lenders are offering homebuyers fixed  rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other  rates and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money the decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the u k they were the mainstay of the business in the u s up until only a few years ago but in the early s  rates soared u s lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as pct to induce them to retain their accounts as a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge the survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds we very much have the example of the u s thrifts in mind said a spokesman for abbey national building society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation s two largest building societies and by national westminster bank plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry  rates even below those on the variable rate loans of course they are less profitable than other variable rate mortgages said a spokesman for midland bank plc which earlier this year said it earmarked mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because it was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product trustee savings bank plc tsb was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at pct earlier this year the mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days according to a spokeswoman everybody loves an under pct mortgage she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of pct of its volume in short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of  rates if  rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets but if  rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money household mortgage co had planned to offer a year fixed rate mortgage after the june elections on the assumption that a conservative party victory would help money market rates fall further according to duncan young managing director young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising  rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being he said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably however he said that when the household mortgage co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them this means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages in the u s where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years reuter
